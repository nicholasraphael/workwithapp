#Inspiration
The observation that kids in college tend to not work out often due to a busy schedule and lack of motivation. We thought of ways to connect them to build a campus community around fitness.

#What it does
The application will allow for a person to join or create time slots to workout with another person on their campus. The campus has a variety of teams (based on colors) and each team will get rewarded and increase in rank throughout the semester for the number of persons completing workouts in each team

#How we built it
The design was done in adobe illustrator and most coding in Android Studio and Java.

#Challenges 
We had never worked together on a team before with one another, and we never coded android applications from scratch with no guidance.

#Accomplishments
Coding in android studio to build a fully working application

#learned
Android Studio and teamwork

#What's next for WorkWith
a few iterations and ios application
